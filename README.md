•Wrote Python to create a game to control a lander that descending toward the moon at a slow enough speed.

•Simulated gravity to accelerate the craft towards the moon's surface and simulated the falling meteors in the environment.

•Added controls for thrust, which accelerates the craft in the direction it’s currently facing, and turning, which adjusts the orientation of the craft to the left or right.
